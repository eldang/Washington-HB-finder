		<h2>What's this?</h2>
		<p>
			To its credit, the Washington State Legislature provides a standard set of information about bills before it, with very regular URLs that make it easy to look key things up about any bill with just its number. This page is just a shortcut to save me having to type all this stuff over and over again. I hope it helps you too.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clicking the submit link above with a valid HB or SB number and biennium (it comes prefilled to the current one) will open new tabs with the following information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Concise bill digest. (<b>Beware</b>: these are sometimes deliberately misleading. If you don't already know the background to a bill, don't trust the digest on its own.)</li>
			<li>Full text of the bill.</li>
			<li>"Text of a Legislative Document" page with links to other info about a bill.  This includes links to the above 2 things, and <i>if</i> other documents have been prepared (e.g. analyses, amended versions) it will list those as well.</li>
			<li>Bill Summary page which shows its current status and links to all its sponsors.</li>
			<li><i>For current session bills only</i>: Comment page which finds your District, Senator and 2 Representatives if you enter your address, and gives you an easy way to submit email comments to them about this bill.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Every source I read tells me that phoning lawmakers has far more impact than emailing.  My own strategy is to prioritize: use the comment page to submit very brief comments on every bill I have an informed opinion about, but also make calls about the most important ones. You can <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/districtfinder">find your district here</a>, and the links from that page take you to listings with office phone numbers for the individual lawmakers who represent you.
